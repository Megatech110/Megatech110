## “The past is done. The future has plenty of room for change.”


- 🔭 Taking web development as a profession not only fulfils my pocket but also my heart because it has been my passion since my early teenage.
- 🌱 I'm a Software Engineer with over +7 years experiences in this field.
- 👯 So I'm not a new bee and serving me with your project wouldn't cause any loss.
- 💪I believe that people should do things in which they are good at or in which their heart lays.
- 😄Beyond the coding chops, I'm an excellent communicator and team player, I’m passionate about writing and sharing what I’ve learned both with my teammates and the     broader web community. 
- ⚡I really value the ability to not only perform web development work but also help others improve their craft, because I’ve gained so much from others sharing their skills and knowledge.
